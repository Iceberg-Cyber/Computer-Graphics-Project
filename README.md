# Computer Graphics Project - Starship Strike
This project is a space-shooting game that has been implemented in C++ using OpenGL. 
The game objective is to shoot and kill all the enemies on the screen. 
The game is divided into two levels. 
The first level is a practice level designed to help the player familiarize themselves with the game mechanics, controls, and objectives. 
The second level is called the boss level, where the player has to face a challenging boss, a massive creature with multiple lives. 
The player's goal is to defeat the boss by shooting at it while avoiding its attacks. 
Upon defeating the boss, the game ends with an explosion and awards the player with points. 
This project uses the modern OpenGL pipeline and features realistic physics simulation. 
The graphics in the game are created using simple 2D sprites and textures.
